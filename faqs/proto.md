Question:
I don't know which of the Census 2000 summary files I need. What are the differences?

Answer:
The four summary files below for Census 2000 are among the most detailed data products available from the population and housing census.

- [Summary File 1](http://www.census.gov/census2000/sumfile1.html) (SF 1) and [Summary File 2](http://www.census.gov/census2000/sumfile2.html) (SF 2) focus on the information collected on the census short form - namely on age, sex, race, Hispanic/Latino origin, households, families, housing units, and owner/renter status.
- [Summary File 3](http://www.census.gov/census2000/sumfile3.html) (SF 3) and [Summary File 4](http://www.census.gov/census2000/SF4.html) (SF 4) focus on social, economic and housing characteristics compiled from a sample of approximately 19 million housing units (about 1 in 6 households) that received the Census 2000 long-form questionnaire.Topics include income, education, occupation, ancestry, disability, foreign birth, commuting, household financial arrangements, year housing structure built and many other population and housing subjects.

The data in all four files are readily accessible in [American FactFinder](http://factfinder.census.gov/home/saff/main.html?_lang=en) and also can be obtained  on [DVD or CD-ROM](http://www.census.gov/mp/www/cat/decennial_census_2000/) from the Customer Services Center at 1-800-923-8282 or (301) 763-INFO (4636).

All four files show data for states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, counties, county subdivisions, cities, American Indian and Alaska Native areas, Hawaiian Home Lands, and census tracts. SF 1 has the most geographic detail, with data for census block groups and blocks; SF 3 has data for block groups. Both SF 1 and SF 3 have data for ZIP Code Tabulation AreasÂ®, Congressional districts, and metropolitan areas.

SF 1 and SF 3 have data on a larger set of topics than do SF 2 and SF 4. What makes SF 2 and SF 4 special is the vast data on population subgroups found on these files.

SF 2 repeats tables for up to 249 race (e.g., Black, Chinese, Asian Indian, etc.) and Hispanic/Latino groups (e.g., Mexican, Cuban, Salvadoran, etc.), as well as American Indian and Alaska Native tribes. SF 4 repeats tables for these groups and also for up to 86 ancestry groups.

Question:
Can the U.S. Census Bureau help me find information about my family's history?

Answer:
Although censuses are a source of genealogical information, the Census Bureau does not provide these data nor can we assist in locating missing persons or provide recent information on individuals.  In keeping with the Census Bureau's commitment to confidentiality, information collected in the Decennial Census of Population and Housing on individuals does not become available to the public until after a period of 72 years.

[Geneaology Tips](http://www.census.gov/history/www/reference/genealogy/) will help amateur genealogists use census records to fill out their family tree.

You can access personal census records from the 1930 census and earlier through the U.S. National Archvies and Records Administration ([http://www.archives.gov/index.html](http://www.archives.gov/index.html)) [](http://www.census.gov/main/www/pdf.html). Information on all aspects of how to do a genealogical search and National Archives [locations](http://www.archives.gov/locations/states.html) are available.  The 1940 census records will be released to the public on April 2, 2012.
